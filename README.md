How to Run me Locally

First of all, you'll need to [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

You will also need to [install maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

After that you can run `docker-compose up -d` on the root of this project to create all required dependencies eg: database

Then you can run this with `mvn start`
